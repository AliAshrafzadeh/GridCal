# GridCal

This software aims to be a complete platform for power systems research and simulation. [Watch the video](https://youtu.be/O6lv-d8z39k)

It is based on PyPower (MatPower for python) and it is compatible with Matpower files, and many more to come.

Some of the features you'll find already are:

- Power flow
  - Newton Raphson
  - Gauss-Seidel
  - Current iteration (or Zbus)
  - Newton Raphson Iwamoto (robust Newton Raphson)
  - Holomorphic Embedding Power flow
  - DC approximation
  
- The hability to handle island grids

- Time series with load and generation profiles. It includes a nice profile import window
