# GridCal

This software aims to be a complete platform for power systems research and simulation.

It is based on PyPower (MatPower for python) and it is compatible with Matpower files, and many more to come.

Some of the features you'll find already are:

- Power flow
  - Newton Raphson
  - Gauss-Seidel
  - Current iteration (or Zbus)
  - Newton Raphson Iwamoto (robust Newton Raphson)
  - Holomorphic Embedding Power flow
  - DC approximation
  
- The hability to handle island grids

- Time series with load and generation profiles. It includes a nice profile import window
